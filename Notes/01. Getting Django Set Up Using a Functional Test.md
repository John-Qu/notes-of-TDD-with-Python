# 1. Getting Django Set Up Using a Functional Test

## What dose discipline need to come naturally?

> Just like in a Kung Fu movie, you need a bad-tempered and unreasonable master to force you to learn the discipline.

TDD is a martial art. 武术。


## Why choose a goat to stand on our shoulder to watch me?

> The Testing Goat is the unofficial mascot of TDD in the Python testing community.

### mascot

A mascot is any person, animal, or object thought to bring luck, or anything used to represent a group with a common public identity, such as a school, professional sports team, society, military unit, or brand name.

Goat as mascot is Not common. Googled "testing goat", there are few pages except this book's links.

"Goat as a mascot"? It is United States Naval Academy's "Bill the Goat".

> To me, the Testing Goat is a voice inside my head that keeps me on the True Path of Testing - like one of those little angels or demons that pop up above your shoulder in the cartoons, but with a very niche set of concerns.

### angels or demons

 they are antonyms.

### niche

a good word. 作名词是壁龛，职业归宿。

adjective

denoting or relating to products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population: 
* other companies in this space had to adapt to being niche players
* a niche show that ran on late-night television
* the video game industry is no longer niche.

> single-minded as goats are—​bleating “Test first, test first!”

single-minded

> Goats take one step at a time.

Look at this picture taken on the east coast of Morocco.

### So the reasons are:
1. Goats are mascot of TDD community.
2. Goats can be a bet on shoulder bleating.
3. Goats are single-minded.
4. Goats take one step at a time.


## How to test Django is active?


functional_tests.py
```python
from selenium import webdriver

browser = webdriver.Firefox()
browser.get('http://localhost:8000')

assert 'Django' in browser.title
```

- Starting a Selenium "webdriver" to pop up a real Firefox browser window
- Using it to open up a web page which we’re expecting to be served from the local PC
- Checking (making a test assertion) that the page has the word "Django" in its title

```python
browser = webdriver.Chrome()
```
dostn't work.


## How to create a project with Django?

```commandline
$ django-admin.py startproject superlists .
```

> Don’t forget that "." at the end; it’s important!

But WHY?


## What does "superlist folder" do?

To hold stuff that applies to the whole project.


## What is manage.py do?

It is a Swiss Army knife.


## What does the first look of a Django powered web server?

## Why it is pointless to add and commit pyc files to git?

Because they are cache files.


## How about commit without the "-m something"?

You can write commit document in a seperate file with vi.
