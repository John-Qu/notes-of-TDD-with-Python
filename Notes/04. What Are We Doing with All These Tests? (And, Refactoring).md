# 4. What Are We Doing with All These Tests? (And, Refactoring)


## What are the "perfectly good" questions when facing all these tiniest test as a young grasshopper?

- a bit excessive?
- redundant? duplication between the functional tests and the unit tests.
- importing django.urls.resolve, testing Django, thought that was a no-no?
- way too trivial, tests for more complex things?
- could have just skipped to the end? I mean, `home_page = None!?`
- you actually code like this in real life?
- really have value? a bit of a cargo cult?

#### excessive

1. his excessive alcohol consumption: immoderate, 
2. the cost is excessive: exorbitant, extortionate, unreasonable, outrageous,

#### no-no

No-no, baby talk used when talking to a young child, meaning something bad or dangerous; i.e. "a big no-no".
    
#### young grasshopper

"Patience, young grasshopper" comes from a 1970s TV show called "Kung Fu"

#### cargo cult
    
A cargo cult is a belief system among a relatively undeveloped society in which adherents practice superstitious rituals hoping to bring modern goods supplied by a more technologically advanced society. 


## What is the metaphor of TDD?

Kent Beck (who basically invented TDD)

**Programming Is Like Pulling a Bucket of Water Up from a Well**

Often, we are smart, so we succeed. TDD is there to help us out when we’re not so smart. 

TDD is like having a ratchet that lets you save your progress, take a break, and make sure you never slip backwards.

That way you don’t have to be smart *all the time*.


## Why I need to be a bit bloody-minded about TDD discipline?

    Definition of bloody-minded. 
    1 : inclined towards violence or bloodshed. 
    2 chiefly British : stubbornly contrary or obstructive : cantankerous.

It’s not something that comes naturally.

payoffs aren’t immediate but only come in the longer term

you have to force yourself to do it in the moment.


## Why use a rigorous TDD with testing absolutely everything, why not following more relaxed rules?

the danger is that complexity tends to sneak up on you, gradually. You may not notice it happening, but quite soon you’re a boiled frog.

tiny test for two reasons:

1. if they’re really trivial tests, then they won’t take you that long to write them. So stop moaning and just write them already.

2. it’s always good to have a placeholder. much less of a psychological barrier to overcome when the simple function gets a tiny bit more complex. because it’s had tests from the very beginning, adding a new test each time has felt quite natural, and it’s well tested. 

The alternative involves trying to decide when a function becomes “complicated enough”, which is highly subjective, but worse, because there’s no placeholder, it seems like that much more effort, and you’re tempted each time to put it off a little longer, and pretty soon—​frog soup!

So, as with any discipline, you have to take the time to learn the rules before you can break them.


## What tools do we use when writing functional test using selenium.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
```
find_element_by_tag_name, find_element_by_id, and find_elements_by_​tag_name

send_keys, which is Selenium’s way of typing into input elements.

The Keys class (don’t forget to import it) lets us send special keys like Enter.


## Why should we commit atomicly?

What if you regret for your change, and it has been mixed with other changes?

The more atomic your commits, the better.


## What goods does `templates` do for us?

1. It saved us from writing html code into `.py` file, as in `lists/views.py`

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home_page(request):
    return HttpResponse('<html><title>To-Do lists</title></html>')
```

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def home_page(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html')
```
2. Templates are a very powerful feature of Django’s, and their main strength consists of substituting Python variables into HTML text.


## Using `.client`, what comes next and what to note well?

Instead of manually creating an HttpRequest object and calling the view function directly, we call `self.client.get`, passing it the URL `'/'` we want to test.

`.assertTemplateUsed` is the test method that the Django TestCase class provides us. It lets us check what template was used to render a response (NB—it will only work for responses that were retrieved by the test client).

#### NB

Nota bene /ˈnoʊtə ˈbiːni/ is a Latin phrase meaning 'note well'.
Often abbreviated as NB, n.b..


## What is the purpose of this refactoring?

The main point, though, is that instead of testing constants we’re testing our implementation.



## Why didn’t we just use the Django Test Client from the very beginning?

Firstly because it allowed me to introduce concepts one by one, and keep the learning curve as shallow as possible. 

Secondly, because you may not always be using Django to build your apps, and testing tools may not always be available — ​but calling functions directly and examining their responses is always possible!


## What's the difference saying "Am I recommending that you actually work this way? No. I’m recommending that you be able to work this way", by Kent Beck in *Test-Driven Development: By Example*.

I cannot say explicity.


## What's the TDD process with functional and unit tests?

When refactoring, work on either the code or the tests, but not both at once.
