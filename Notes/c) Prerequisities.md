## How HTML Works

I’m also assuming you have a basic grasp of how the web works—​
- what HTML is, 
- what a POST request is
- how to create an HTML page on your PC and 
- look at it in your browser, and 
- understand what a form is and 
- how it might work


## What if I'm not familiar with Django?

It's no matter that no prior knowledge of Django is all right.

but if you’re 
- new to Python and 
- new to web development and 
- new to testing
you may occasionally find that there’s just one too many topics and sets of concepts to try and take on board. 

### What does it mean by "one too many"?

The expression is a mildly critical way of saying you have read Billy Mumphrey stories to excess.

Suppose the perfect number of Billy Mumphrey stories to read is seven.

If you read only six, you have read too few—one too few.

If you read eight, however, you have read too many—one too many.

We use the *one too many* to take the sting out of the criticism: it suggests you have only overindulged to a slight extent. It's probably used most often with respect to alcohol consumption.

> Bob, you're getting just a little loud. I think you've had one too many.

from [What *one too many* means in “you've read one too many stories”](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/18872/what-one-too-many-means-in-youve-read-one-too-many-stories)

### What's the best tutorial of Django? And who the official tutorial is for?

[DjangoGirls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) is the best, most beginner-friendly tutorial I know of. 

The official tutorial is also excellent for more experienced programmers


## Why Don’t use Django 2?

> This is not a short book, there’s a lot of code to follow along with, and at several points I guarantee you are going to be staring at something on your screen that looks nothing like what I say it should in the book. 
At those points, it’s hard enough debugging all the moving parts for any mistakes you might have made, without having to add in the extra possibility that it’s something to do with Django 2 vs Django 1.11.

The point is "extra possibility" about bugs.


## Why suggest (and it’s only a suggestion) that you don’t use an IDE, at least for the duration of this tutorial?

> Sometimes, a basic text editor and a command line are all you have —​when you’re working on a server, for example—​so it’s always worth learning how to use the basic tools first and understanding how they work.

I don't need to work on the server? Yes. So let me use my PyCharm.


## Why not Anaconda?

### What Anaconda is good at?

> It’s particularly popular on Windows and for scientific computing, where it can be hard to get some of the compiled libraries to install.

### Why not use it in web programming?

In the world of web programming it’s much less necessary, so I recommend you do not use Anaconda for this book.

### Why not use it in this tutorial?

Apart from anything else I don’t know enough about it to help you debug any problems with it if they occur!
