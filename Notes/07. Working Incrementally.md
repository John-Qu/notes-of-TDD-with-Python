# 7. Working Incrementally

## What's the difference between "Testing Goat" and "Refactoring Cat"?

## What do you mean by "up-front"?

: being or coming in or at the front: such as a (1) : being in a conspicuous or leading position (2) : frank, forthright
b : playing in a front line (as in football)
c : paid or payable in advance

## What is "Big Design Up Front"?

## instead of using the slightly annoying assertIn/response.content.decode() dance, Django provides the assertContains method, which knows how to deal with responses and the bytes of their content.


## Now we could dive in and add POST request handling to our new view, but that would involve writing a bunch more tests and code, and at this point we’d like to get back to a working state as quickly as possible.


## pay attention to trailing slashes, incidentally. It’s /new, with no trailing slash. The convention I’m using is that URLs without a trailing slash are "action" URLs which modify the database.
