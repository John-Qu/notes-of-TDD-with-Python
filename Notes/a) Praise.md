## Kenneth Reitz

> This book is far more than an introduction to Test Driven Development—it’s a complete best-practices crash course, from start to finish, into modern web application development with Python.

### what is actually "best-practices"?

> A best practice is a method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternatives because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means or because it has become a standard way of doing things, e.g., a standard way of complying with legal or ethical requirements. - from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice)

> Best practices are a set of guidelines, ethics or ideas that represent the most efficient or prudent course of action. Best practices are often set forth by an authority, such as a regulator, governing body or internally by management, depending on the circumstances. - from [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/best_practices.asp)

It is a high praise.

### What's "crash course"?

> Crash Course (sometimes stylized as CrashCourse) is an educational YouTube channel started by the Green brothers. - from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Course_(YouTube))

It's not courses about how to crash a glass cup or a script of code.
It is a particular brand mark.

## Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfield

### Who are Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfield?

> Harry’s book is what we wish existed when we were learning Django. 

They are the authors of "[Two Scoops of Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11)". They knew this topic well.

Before becoming couple, they used to be Daniel Greenfield and Audrey Roy.

[]Two scoops press](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/) is their little company behind this book.

This book up-to-date version is 1.11 and [work fine with Django 2.0](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-2.0-code-examples). Its ebook is 291RMB on their site. On web, there is Django 1.8 version [here](http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Daniel-Roy-Greenfeld-Audrey-Roy-Greenfeld-Two-Scoops-of-Django_-Best-Practices-for-Django-1.8-Two-Scoops-Press-2015.pdf)

> At a pace that’s achievable and yet delightfully challenging, it provides excellent instruction for Django and various test practices. 

Achievable. Fine. Challenging? Great.

> The material on Selenium alone makes the book worth purchasing, but there’s so much more!

### What is Selenium?

Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well. - from [SeleniumHQ](https://www.seleniumhq.org/)

"Not an official" documentation about Selenium with Python is [here](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).

It is [said](https://cuiqingcai.com/2599.html) to be effective tool to scrap web data.
