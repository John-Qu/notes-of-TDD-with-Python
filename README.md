# Notes-of-Test_Driven_Development_with_Python

This is a personal experience learning *Test-Driven Development with Python*.

The author is Harry J.W. Percival. He has put this book on his [www.obeythetestinggoat.com](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc), and encouraging you to read on-line first.

I bought this book's Chinese version from [ituring publisher](http://www.ituring.com.cn/book/2052) on 2018-07-25.

It is about TDD, it is not about Python or Django. I began to read it from 2018-07-27. By now(2018-08-07), I have read the first part of the book. I confessed that the author's main aim is to impart a methodology—​a way of doing web development, which makes for better web apps and happier developers. It is not a book about web development with Django etc. It is a step-by-step tutorial showing TDD methodology!

The sentence structure and word are sometimes a little weird, maybe one too accurate. The author is a Frenchman and now working for pythonanywhere Inc in London.

I found this book not easy to read, but worth the 3~6 hours per chapter. I would like to go though it and come back again and again. 

Harry opens a window. Look through it, I find hope, hope to be a happy hacker.
